  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">1. Arjuna said, "Now, O Krsna, what is the position or basis of those who, despite leaving aside the injunction of the Sastra, still worship with faith? Is it Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas?"</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">2. The Lord said, "The faith of embodied beings is threefold, born of their own nature and constituted of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Now, listen to me about it."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">3. O Arjuna, the faith of everyone is in accordance with their inner organ (Antahkarana). Each person consists of faith; whatever their faith is, that is who they are.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">4. The sattvic types worship the gods; the rajasic types worship yaksas and rakshasas; and the others, the tamasic types, worship the departed ancestors and hosts of bhutas.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">5. Those men who practice terrible austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to ostentation and conceit, and prompted by the force of sensual desires and passions;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">6. These foolish men, who torture the group of elements in their bodies and Me, who dwell within the body—know them to be demoniacal in their resolves.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">7. Even the food that is dear to all is threefold; so too are sacrifices, austerities, and gifts. Listen to this distinction among them.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">8. Foods that promote longevity, intellectual alertness, strength, health, pleasure, and happiness, and those that are sweet, oily, substantial, and agreeable, are dear to sattvic men.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. Foods that are bitter, sour, very salty, excessively heating, highly pungent, dry, and burning are all dear to Rajasika men; they cause pain, sorrow, and disease.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10. That food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, decayed, rejected, unclean, is dear to those of a Tamasic nature.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">11. The sacrifice (worship) marked by Sattva is what is offered by those who desire no fruit and have the conviction that it should be performed as prescribed in the scriptures.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">12. But that sacrifice which is offered with the intention of gaining a reward and for the sake of show, know it, O Arjuna, to be Rajasic.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">13. That sacrifice which is devoid of authority, which uses offerings not sanctioned by the Sastras, which is performed without recitation of hymns and devoid of gifts and faith - that, they say, is marked by Tamas.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">14. Worshiping the gods, the twice-born, the preceptors, the enlightened ones, practicing purity, uprightness, continence, and non-injury—these are called austerity of the body.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15. Speech that causes no shock, is true, pleasant, and beneficial, and also the practice of reciting scriptures, is called the austerity of speech.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">16. Serenity of mind, benevolence, silence, self-control, and purity of mind—these are known as austerity of the mind.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">17. The threefold austerity, practiced with supreme faith by men who desire no fruit and are devoted—they call it austerity of Sattva.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. That austerity, practiced with ostentation for the sake of gaining respect, praise, and reverence, is here said to be Rajasa. It is unsteady and impermanent.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">19. That austerity which is practised from deluded notions by means of self-torture or to injure another is said to be Tamasika.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20. Gifts given with the feeling that it is one's own duty to give, to one who makes no return, at the proper place and time to the deserving person—that is said to be sattvika.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">21. But that which is given as a consideration for something received or in expectation of a future reward, or grudgingly, is called a Rajasika gift.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">22. That gift which is given at the wrong place, wrong time, to an unworthy recipient, without due respect and with contempt, is called the gift of a Tamasa nature.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">23. Om, Tat, Sat—thus, Brahman is denoted by this threefold expression. In the past, Brahmanas, the Vedas, and sacrifices were ordained in association with these.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">24. Therefore, the Veda-enjoined sacrificial acts, gifts, and austerities, expounded by the Vedas, or those belonging to the first three stations, are always begun after pronouncing Om at the beginning.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">25. Acts of sacrifice, austerity, and various gifts are performed without aiming at a reward by those who seek release, after pronouncing Tat.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">26. This term "Sat" is used in the sense of existence and goodness. And so also, O Arjuna, the word "Sat" is applied to an auspicious action.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">27. Devotion to sacrifice, austerity, and gifts is also referred to as Sat; and thus, any action for such purposes is known as Sat.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">28. Whatever offering or gift is made, whatever austerity is practiced, and whatever action is performed without faith, that is called Asat, O Arjuna. It is of no value here or hereafter.</li>
