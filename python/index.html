    <li class="list-group-item">1. Dhṛtarāṣṭra said: “O Sanjaya, what did my people and the Pāṇḍavas do, gathered together on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?”</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">2. Sanjaya said: King Duryodhana, upon seeing the Pandava army in battle array, approached his teacher Drona and said these words.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">3. Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the Pandavas, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your intelligent disciple.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">4. There (in that army) are heroes, great bowmen, such as Bhima and Arjuna; Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada, a mighty warrior;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">5. Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya, the best among men;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">6. Yudhamanyu, the valiant one, and Uttamaujas, the strong one; and also the son of Subhadra, as well as the sons of Draupadi, all mighty warriors.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">7. Know, O best of Brahmanas, those who are important on our side—those who are the commanders of my army. I shall name them to refresh your memory.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">8. Yourself, Bhisma, Karna, the victorious Krpa, Asvatthama, Vikarna, and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. And there are many other heroes who are determined to give up their lives for my sake. They are all experts in using manifold missiles and dexterous in battle.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10. Our force is inadequate, guarded by Bhisma, while their force is adequate, guarded by Bhima.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">11. Therefore, all of you, taking your places firmly in your respective divisions, should guard Bhisma at all costs.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">12. Then the valiant grandsire Bhisma, the senior-most of the Kuru clan, roared like a lion and blew his conch with the intention of cheering up Duryodhana.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">13. Then suddenly conchs, kettle drums, trumpets, tabors, and blow horns blared forth, and the sound was terrific.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">14. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, stationed in their great chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15. Sri Krishna blew his conch, Pancajanya, Arjuna his Devadatta, and Bhima of terrible deeds blew his great conch, Paundra.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">16. King Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch, Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs, Sughosa and Manipuspaka.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">17. And the King of Kasi, the supreme bowman, Sikandi the mighty warrior, Dhrstadyumna, and Virata; and Satyaki, the invincible;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, as well as the strong-armed son of Subhadra—all, O King, blew their respective conchs again and again.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">19. And that tumultuous uproar, reverberating through heaven and earth, rent the hearts of Dhrtarastra's sons.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20. Then Arjuna, whose banner crest was Hanuman, on beholding the sons of Dhrtarastra arrayed, took up his bow, while missiles were beginning to fly.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">21. And he spoke, O Lord of the Earth, these words to Sri Krishna: Arjuna said, “Draw up my chariot, O Krishna, between the two armies.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">22. So that I may have a good look at those who are standing, eager to fight, and know with whom I must fight in this enterprise of war.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">23. I wish to see those gathered here ready to fight in this battle in order to please the evil-minded son of Dhrtarashtra.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">24. Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krishna drew up the best of chariots between the two armies, in full view of Bhisma, Drona, and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra. He then said, "O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">25. Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krishna drew up the best of chariots between the two armies, in full view of Bhisma, Drona, and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra. He then said, "O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">26. Then, as Arjuna looked on, he saw standing there fathers, grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and comrades.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">27. Fathers-in-law and dear friends in both armies, when Arjuna saw all these kinsmen arrayed,</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">28. He was filled with deep compassion and said these words in despair:</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">29. My limbs have weakened, my mouth has become parched, my body is trembling, and my hairs are standing on end.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">30. The bow Gandiva slips from my hand and my skin is burning. I can no longer stand. My mind seems to be reeling.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">31. I see, Kṛṣṇa, inauspicious omens. I foresee no good in slaying my kinsmen in battle.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">32. I desire no victory, nor empire, nor pleasures. What have we to do with empire, O Krishna, or enjoyment, or even life?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">33. Those for whose sake we desire empire, enjoyment, and pleasures, stand here in war, renouncing life and wealth.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">34. all these are to be regarded as one's own self.

Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen—all these are to be regarded as one's own self.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">35. I would not slay them, even if they might slay me, for the sovereignty of the three worlds—how much less for this earth, O Krsna?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">36. If we were to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra, what joy would be ours, O Krsna? Sin alone would accrue to us if we killed these murderous felons.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">37. Therefore, it is not befitting for us to slay our kin, the sons of Dhrtarastra. For if we kill our kinsmen, O Krsna, how can we be happy?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">38. Though these people, whose minds are overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of a clan and no sin in treachery to friends,</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">39. Why should we not learn to shun this crime—we who see the evil of ruining a clan, O Krishna?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">40. 

With the ruin of a clan, its ancient traditions perish, and when traditions perish, lawlessness overtakes the whole clan.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">41. When lawlessness prevails, O Krsna, the women of the clan become corrupted; when women become corrupted, there arises an intermixing of classes.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">42. This mixing of classes leads to hell for the clan itself and its destroyers; for the spirits of their ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual offerings of food and water.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">43. By the sins of the clan-destroyers who bring about intermixing of classes, the ancient traditions of the clans and classes are destroyed.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">44. For those whose clan laws are destroyed, dwelling in hell is ordained, O Krishna; thus, we have heard.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">45. Alas! We have resolved to commit a great sin, for we are ready to slay our kin out of desire for sovereignty and enjoyment.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">46. If the well-armed sons of Dhrtarastra should slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">47. Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus on the battlefield, Arjuna threw aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot seat, his heart overwhelmed with grief.</li>
