  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">1. The Lord said, "I shall declare to you, who does not cavil, this most mysterious knowledge, together with its special knowledge, knowing which you will be freed from evil."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">2. This is the royal science, the royal mystery, the supreme purifier. It is realized through direct experience, is in accord with Dharma, is pleasant to practice, and is abiding.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">3. Men devoid of faith in this Dharma, O scorcher of foes, ever remain without attaining Me, on the mortal path of Samsara.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">4. This entire universe is pervaded by Me, in an unmanifest form. All beings abide in Me, but I do not abide in them.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">5. Yet, beings do not remain in Me. Behold My divine Yoga. I am the sustainer of all beings, yet I am not in them. It is My will alone that causes their existence.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">6. As the powerful element air, moving everywhere, ever remains in the ether, know that so too all beings abide in Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">7. All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Prakriti at the end of a cycle of time; again, I send them forth at the beginning of a cycle of time.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">8. Controlling the Prakṛti, which is My own, I send forth again and again this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakṛti.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. But these actions do not bind Me, O Arjuna, for I remain detached from them, as if I were unconcerned.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10. Under My supervision, Prakrti gives birth to all mobile and immobile entities, and thus, O Arjuna, the world revolves.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">11. Fools disregard Me, dwelling in a human form, not knowing My higher nature as the Supreme Lord of all beings.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">12. Senseless people have a nature that is deluding and similar to that of rakshasas and asuras. Their hopes are futile, their actions are futile, and their knowledge is futile.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">13. But the great-souled ones, O Arjuna, who are associated with My divine nature, worship Me with an unwavering mind, knowing Me to be the immutable source of all beings.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">14. Aspiring for eternal communion with Me, they worship Me, always singing My praises, striving with steadfast resolution and bowing down to Me in devotion.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15. Others, besides offering the sacrifice of knowledge, also worship Me as One, who is characterized by diversity in countless ways and is multiform (in My Cosmic aspect).</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">16. I am Kratu, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering to the manes, I am the herb, I am the Mantra, I am the clarified butter, I am the fire, I am the oblation.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">17. I am the father, mother, creator, and grandfather of the universe; I am the purifier. I am the syllable Om, as well as Rk, Saman, and Yajus.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the friend. I am the origin, the dissolution, the basis for preservation, and the imperishable seed.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">19. I give heat, I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, O Arjuna. I am the being and the non-being.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20. Those who are versed in the three Vedas, having been purified from sin by drinking the Soma juice, pray for passage to heaven and worship Me through sacrifices. Reaching the holy realm of the chief of the gods, they enjoy celestial pleasures in heaven.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">21. Having enjoyed the spacious world of heaven, they return to the world of mortals, their merit having been exhausted. Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals and are drawn by desires come and go.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">22. Those who, excluding all else, think of Me and worship Me, aspiring after eternal union with Me, I look after their prosperity and welfare (Yoga and Ksema).</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">23. Even those who are devoted to other divinities with faith in their hearts, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, though not in accordance with the Sastras.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">24. For, I am the only enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices. They do not recognize Me in My true nature; hence, they fall.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">25. Devotees of gods go to the gods; manes-worshippers go to the manes; worshippers of Bhutas go to the Bhutas; and those who worship Me come to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">26. Whoever offers Me with true devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or some water, I accept this offering made with devotion by them who are pure of heart.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">27. Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer, whatever you give away, whatever austerity you practice, O Arjuna, do that as an offering to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">28. Thus equipped in mind with the Yoga of renunciation, you will free yourself from the bonds of Karma, productive of both auspicious and inauspicious fruits. Thus liberated, you will come to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">29. I am the same to all creation; there is none hateful or dear to me. But those who worship me with devotion abide in me, and I in them.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">30. If even the most sinful man worships Me with undivided devotion, he should be regarded as holy, for he has rightly resolved.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">31. Quickly, he becomes righteous and obtains everlasting peace. Affirm on My behalf, O Arjuna, that My devotee never perishes.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">32. By taking refuge in Me, even those of evil birth, women, Vaisyas, and Sudras, attain the supreme state.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">33. How much more then, for the pure Brahmanas and royal sages who are My devotees! Having obtained this transient and joyless world, they should worship Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">34. Focus your mind on Me, be My devotee, worship Me. Bow down to Me. Engaging your mind in this manner and regarding Me as the supreme goal, you will come to Me.</li>
