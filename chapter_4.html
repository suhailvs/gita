  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">1. The Lord said, "I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; Vivasvan taught it to Manu; Manu declared it to Iksvaku."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">2. Thus handed down in succession, the royal sages knew this (Karma Yoga). But with a long lapse of time, O Arjuna, that Yoga was lost to the world.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">3. It is the same ancient Yoga that I am now teaching you, for you are My devotee and My friend. For, this is a supreme mystery.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">4. Arjuna said, "Your birth was later, and Vivasvan's birth was earlier. How then can I understand that you taught it in the beginning?"</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">5. The Lord said, "Many of My births have passed, O Arjuna, as have yours. I know them all, but you do not know them."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">6. Though I am birthless and of immutable nature, and the Lord of all beings, yet by employing My own Nature (Prakrti), I am born out of My own free will.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">7. Whenever there is a decline of Dharma, O Arjuna, and an uprising of Adharma, then I incarnate myself.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">8. For the protection of the good and the destruction of the wicked, for the establishment of Dharma, I am born from age to age.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. He who thus knows in truth My divine birth and actions does not get rebirth after leaving the body; he will come to Me, O Arjuna.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10. Freed from desire, fear, and wrath, absorbed in Me, depending upon Me, purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained My state.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">11. Whoever resorts to Me in any manner, I favor them in the same manner; men experience Me alone in different ways, O Arjuna.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">12. Those who desire the fruits of their ritualistic acts, sacrifice to the gods here; for, success quickly accrues in the world of men.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">13. The system of four stations was created by Me, according to the distinction of Gunas and Karma. Though I am their creator, know Me to be non-agent and immutable.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">14. Works cannot contaminate Me. There is no desire for the fruits of actions in Me. He who understands this is not bound by actions.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15. Knowing thus, even ancient seekers of liberation did their work. Therefore, do your work only as the ancients did in olden times.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">16. What is action? What is non-action? Even the wise are puzzled in respect of these. I shall declare to you that kind of action, knowing which you will be freed from evil.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">17. For, there is what ought to be known in action; likewise, there is what ought to be known in multi-form action; and there is what ought to be understood in non-action. Thus, mysterious is the way of action.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. He who sees inaction in action and also action in inaction is wise among men. He is fit for release and has accomplished all actions.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">19. He whose every undertaking is free from desire and delusive identification (of the body with the self), whose actions are burned up in the fire of knowledge—the wise describe him as a sage.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20. Having renounced attachment to the fruits of their actions, ever contented with the eternal self, and dependent on none, one does not act at all, even while being engaged in action.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">21. Free from desire, his intellect and mind controlled, having given up all possessions, and doing bodily work only, he is not subject to evil.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">22. Content with what chance may bring, rising above the pairs of opposites, free from ill-will, even-minded in success and failure, he acts, yet is not bound.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">23. One whose attachments have been relinquished, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, and who works only for sacrifices—their Karma is entirely dissolved.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">24. Brahman is the instrument with which to offer; Brahman is the oblation. By Brahman is the oblation offered into the fire of Brahman; Brahman alone is to be attained by one who meditates on Him in their works.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">25. Some yogis resort only to the sacrifice relating to gods; others offer sacrifice into the fire of Brahman solely through sacrifice.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">26. Others offer as oblations hearing and other senses into the fires of restraint. Some others offer as oblations the objects of the senses, such as sound and the rest, into the fires of their senses.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">27. Some again offer as an oblation the functions of the senses and the activity of the vital breaths into the fire of the Yoga of restraint of the mind, kindled by knowledge.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">28. Self-controlled and firm of resolve, others perform the sacrifice of material objects or austerities or yoga; while others offer their scriptural study and knowledge.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">29. Others, with restricted diets, are devoted to the control of breath. Some sacrifice the inward breath in the outward breath; similarly, others sacrifice the outward breath in the inward breath. Some others, stopping the flow of both the inward and outward breaths, sacrifice the inward and outward breaths.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">30. All these know the meaning of sacrifices, and through sacrifices, their sins are eradicated. Those who subsist on the ambrosial food, the remnants of sacrifices, go to eternal Brahman.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">31. This world is not for one who makes no sacrifice; how then for the other, O Arjuna?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">32. Thus, many forms of sacrifices have been spread out as means of reaching Brahman (individual self in its own nature). Know that all of these are born of actions. Knowing thus, you will be free.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">33. The sacrifice of knowledge is superior to material sacrifice. O Arjuna, all actions and everything else culminate in knowledge.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">34. Know this through prostration, questioning, and service. The wise who have realized the truth will instruct you in knowledge.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">35. Knowing this, O Arjuna, you will not fall again into delusion in this way—by that knowledge, you will see all beings without exception in yourself and then in Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">36. Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you can cross over all sins by the boat of knowledge alone.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">37. Just as a burning fire turns fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge turn all karmas to ashes.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">38. For there is no purifier equal to knowledge; he who is perfected in Karma Yoga finds this knowledge of his own accord in himself in due time.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">39. He who has faith, is intent on it, and has mastered his senses, attains knowledge. Having attained knowledge, he quickly goes to supreme peace.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">40. The ignorant, the faithless, and the doubting one perish; for the doubting one, there is neither this world nor the one beyond, nor happiness.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">41. Actions do not bind him, O Arjuna, who has renounced them through Karma Yoga and whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who thus possesses a steady mind.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">42. Therefore, sever, with the sword of knowledge, this doubt present in your heart resulting from ignorance concerning the Self. Practice this Yoga, O Arjuna, and arise.</li>
