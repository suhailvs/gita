  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    
    <li class="list-group-item">1. Arjuna said: Which of these has greater knowledge of yoga—those devotees who meditate on You, ever integrated, or those who meditate on the Imperishable and the Unmanifest?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">2. The Lord said, "Those who, ever integrated with Me and possessing supreme faith, worship Me, focusing their minds on Me—these are considered by Me to be the highest among the yogis."</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">3. But those who meditate on the Imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, omnipresent, unthinkable, common to all beings, immovable, and constant—</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">4. Having subdued all the senses, being even-minded, and engaged in the welfare of all beings, they too come to Me only.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">5. Greater is the difficulty for those whose minds are thus attached to the unmanifest, for the way of the unmanifest is hard to reach for embodied beings.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">6. For those who dedicate all their actions to Me, hold Me as their supreme goal, are intent on Me, and worship Me, meditating on Me with exclusive devotion;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">7. Those whose minds are thus focused on Me, I soon become their savior from the ocean of mortal life.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">8. Focus your mind on Me alone; and let your intellect enter into Me. Then, you will live in Me alone; there is no doubt.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. If now you are unable to focus your mind on Me, then seek to reach Me, O Arjuna, through the practice of repetition.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">10. If you are incapable of even this practice of repetition, then devote yourself to My deeds. For even by working for My sake, you will attain perfection.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">11. If you are unable to do even this—that is, take refuge in My Yoga—then, with your self-control, renounce the fruits of every action.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">12. Far better is knowledge of the Self than the repeated practice (of remembrance of the Lord). Better is meditation than this knowledge; better is renunciation of the fruits of action than meditation. From such renunciation, peace ensues.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">13. He who never hates any being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free from the feelings of "I" and "mine," who looks upon all pain and pleasure equally, and who is enduring;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">14. He who is content, who meditates ever, is self-restrained, and is firm in his convictions, and has his mind and reason dedicated to Me—he is dear to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">15. He from whom the world has no cause to be frightened, who is not frightened by the world, who is free from joy and impatience, fear, and aversion - he is dear to me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">16. He who is free from desires, who is pure, expert, indifferent, and free from agony, who has renounced every undertaking—he is dear to me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">17. He who does not rejoice, nor hate, nor grieve, nor desire, who renounces both good and evil, and who is full of devotion to Me—such a devotee is dear to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. He who is the same to foe and friend, honor and dishonor, who is alike to both cold and heat, pleasure and pain, and who is free from all attachments;</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">19. He who regards both blame and praise alike, who is silent and content with any lot, who has no home, who is firm of mind, and who is devoted to Me - such a man is dear to Me.</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">20. But those devotees who follow this nectar of virtuous duty, as taught above, who are full of faith and regard Me as the Supreme, are exceedingly dear to Me.</li>
