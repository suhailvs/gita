    <li class="list-group-item">6. The seven great seers of yore, as well as the four Manus, all possessing My mental disposition, were born from My mind. All these creatures of the world are descended from them.</li>

    <li class="list-group-item">8. I am the origin of all; from me everything proceeds. Thinking thus, the wise worship me with all devotion (Bhava).</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">9. With their minds focused on Me, their pranas centered in Me, inspiring one another and always speaking of Me, they live in contentment and bliss at all times.</li>

All the seers proclaim You as the eternal, divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn, and all-pervading. So too do the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim. You Yourself also proclaim this."</li>

    <li class="list-group-item">17. How can I, Your devotee, know You by constantly meditating on You? And in what ways, O Lord, should I meditate on You?</li>
    
    <li class="list-group-item">18. Speak to me again in full, O Krishna, about Your attributes and glories. For I am not sated by hearing Your ambrosial words.</li>
